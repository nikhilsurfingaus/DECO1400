        <p> the Island plays host to an 18 hole round gold game. Based on a separate smaller island from 
            the main island, guests take an amazing helicopter ride across the reef littered gorge separating 
            the two islands on their way to a gorgeous golf circuit. Each guest is provided with a golf kart with
            clubs complementary with the booking. Guests can also book a member of staff to drive them as well 
            as write down scores for each hole.
